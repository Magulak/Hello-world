# Hello-world
Testing how to create repositories

Getting started into JAVA using exercism (its really cool, here is a link https://exercism.io/my/tracks), I decided that I will learn Java with a friend, so why not use GitHub and work on some exercises together? We will be going through JAVA course, so we will pump up our GitHub and JAVA knowledge. 
Our plan is to create simple app on android that will help us keep track of our weights and amounts of reps on gym, we are aware that market already has apps like that and I m sure that they will be better than ours, but we have to start somwhere right? 

There[https://exercism.io/profiles/MagulonHandle] is link to my exercism profile, You can check out my solutions for exercises here, don't expect anything special, I m a beginer.
